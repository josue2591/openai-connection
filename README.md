## Project Status
The project is currently in a very early stage of development. While the basic functionality has been implemented, there are still various tasks and enhancements to be addressed.

## Description
Offers seamless integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 model, acting as a foundational connection for related modules. While it functions independently, its true potential emerges when combined with complementary modules. By adopting a modular approach, we avoid overwhelming you with unnecessary features or submodules you might end up not using. Instead, you have the flexibility to install only the specific modules that suit your needs.

## Features
Connects to OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
Uses the advanced language features of GPT-4.

## Post-Installation
Configure OpenAI API Key: Start by setting up the OpenAI API Key. You can do this on the settings page found at `/admin/config/system/openai-connection`.

Please note that further development and improvements are required to enhance the functionality and stability of the module.
